> **Current release: `v0.8.1` — brutal-review hotfix.** Closes three MAJORs from the v0.8.0 post-ship cold-read review: a false-negative-producing sanitizer-registry bug on `path.normalize` / `path.resolve` / `path.basename` (removed — they do not prevent path traversal on their own), stale MCP tool names in the tutorial that broke first-contact for every MCP user (rewritten), and a scope gap in the Phase 5 conditional-import confidence downgrade that left the if/else form at full confidence (extended). Three remaining MAJORs (GitHub Action default pin, blanket logging-checker suppression in self-scan config, HOC text-match precision) deferred to v0.9 with documented rationale. See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) §[0.8.1] for full detail.

> **Prior release: `v0.8.0` — type-aware expansion.** Closes the four type-aware gaps deferred from v0.7 (HOC binding, generic pass-through return-taint, method-call cross-file via TypeChecker, conditional-import confidence downgrade). Extends `TYPED_SINK_MODULES` beyond `child_process` to fs / path / crypto / http / https. Adds `Date.parse` blocklist + URL-regex-whitelist sanitizer (closes v0.7 cal-com FP). Corpus doubled (3 → 6 OSS projects) toward the n≥20 cross-file measurement runway. Structural self-match refinement takes AEGIS-on-itself from 0/F to 973/A. Ships [docs/GETTING-STARTED.md](./docs/GETTING-STARTED.md) for 5-minute onboarding. See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full v0.8 scope + honest score framing.

> **Two scores, don't confuse them:**
> - **"Internal Maturity 7.7/10"** (badge above) — AEGIS's *own* honest self-assessment of its maturity as a product. Tracks over releases. Different from the validator's precision-tier system.
> - **"0-1000" (see Scoring section below)** — the score AEGIS *outputs* for a scanned project. Based on weighted findings in that project's code. Graded FORTRESS → CRITICAL.

## What is AEGIS?

AEGIS (Automated Enterprise-Grade Inspection Suite) is a **stack-specific security scanner for Next.js + Supabase** with 39 built-in scanners, an AST-based cross-file taint tracker, and a 0-1000 scoring system. It finds vulnerabilities that generic SAST tools (Semgrep, CodeQL, SonarQube) miss because they lack framework-specific rules.

**Best used alongside Semgrep**, not instead of it. AEGIS covers the Supabase / Next.js-specific gaps (multi-tenant isolation, RLS bypass, Server Component data leaks, Zod enforcement) while Semgrep covers the generic SAST space.

What makes it different: AEGIS tracks **data flow** through your code — within a file and across module boundaries:

```typescript
// Same-file taint (works since v0.5):
const id = req.body.id;           // Source: user input
const trimmed = id.trim();         // Propagates: method call
const query = `SELECT * WHERE id = ${trimmed}`;  // Propagates: template literal
db.query(query);                   // Sink: SQL Injection (CWE-89, CRITICAL)

// Cross-file taint (new in v0.7):
// lib/db.ts    — export function runQuery(sql: string) { db.query(sql); }
// api/route.ts — import { runQuery } from '../lib/db';
//                runQuery(req.body.q);   // ← AEGIS traces this cross-module
```

Per-CWE sanitizer awareness means `parseInt()` blocks SQL injection but not XSS, and `DOMPurify.sanitize()` blocks XSS but not SQL injection.

On top of that: 37 built-in regex scanners + 1 AST taint analyzer + 1 RPC-specific SQLi scanner, 16 external tool wrappers (Semgrep, Gitleaks, ZAP, Trivy, …), 5 live attack probes, 4 compliance frameworks (GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS), an MCP Server for AI agents, a VS Code extension, and a GitHub Action with PR comments.

## What AEGIS finds that generic SAST tools miss

These are **stack-specific** vulnerabilities in Next.js + Supabase apps. Generic tools don't have rules for them because they're framework-specific patterns:

| Vulnerability | Category |
|---|---|
| Missing `tenant_id` filter — cross-tenant data leak | Multi-Tenant |
| `service_role` RLS bypass in API routes | Supabase |
| SQLi via `.rpc()` template interpolation in function name | Supabase |
| Mass assignment — unvalidated `request.json()` to `.insert()` | Supabase |
| No rate limiting on sensitive endpoint | Next.js API |
| Missing auth guard on API route | Next.js API |
| Server Component passing full DB record to client (CWE-200) | React Server Components |
| Prompt injection — user input in LLM prompts | AI / LLM |
| Missing Zod `.strict()` on mutation schemas | Validation |
| No pagination on database query | Performance / DoS |

AEGIS is not a Semgrep replacement — it's a **Semgrep multiplier**. When Semgrep is installed, AEGIS wraps it automatically and you get both.

---

## Taint Analysis Engine

The AST-based taint tracker uses the TypeScript Compiler API to follow user input through your code — within a single file and across module boundaries.

**Per-CWE sanitizer awareness:**

| Sanitizer | Blocks SQLi | Blocks XSS | Blocks SSRF | Blocks CmdInj |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `parseInt()` | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| `DOMPurify.sanitize()` | No | Yes | No | No |
| `encodeURIComponent()` | No | Yes | Yes | No |
| `z.parse()` (Zod) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Cross-file propagation** (v0.7) — a function summary cache lets the tracker follow taint into an imported function, check whether any parameter reaches a sink (and with which CWE), and emit a finding at the caller's file with a `relatedLocations` pointer back to the origin file. Supported patterns:

- Bare-identifier callees: `import { runQuery } from './lib'; runQuery(tainted);`
- Arrow-function-variable exports: `export const fn = (x) => sink(x);`
- Default exports: `export default function (x) { sink(x); }`
- Declaration-style exports: `export { foo };` and `export { foo as bar };`
- Barrel re-exports up to depth 5.
- Cross-file sanitizer recognition — imports of a function that wraps its arg through a known sanitizer suppress the finding.

v0.8 closes the four type-aware gaps from v0.7: HOC / curry consumption at binding sites (policy §9), generic pass-through return-taint via `summary.returnsTainted`, method-call cross-file via TypeChecker symbol resolution, and conditional-import confidence downgrade. Known limitations (scoped to v0.9+): regex-guard awareness inside cross-file callee bodies, SSRF URL-arg vs header-arg distinction for `fetch(url, {headers})`, cross-file precision measurement (pending n≥20 emissions). See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Scoring

| Score | Grade | Badge |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 950-1000 | S | FORTRESS |
| 850-949 | A | HARDENED |
| 700-849 | B | SOLID |
| 500-699 | C | NEEDS_WORK |
| 300-499 | D | AT_RISK |
| 0-299 | F | CRITICAL |

Certain findings (eval injection, hardcoded secrets, unauthed admin routes) are **BLOCKER** severity and force the score to 0 / F immediately.

## MCP Server — use AEGIS from any AI coding agent

AEGIS ships a Model Context Protocol server so AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, Zed, …) can run scans, query findings, and check compliance posture directly from the conversation. Install locally, then register the server in your agent's MCP config.

**Install:**

```bash
npm install -D @aegis-scan/mcp-server
```

**Register (Claude Code** — `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`**, Cursor** — `.cursor/mcp.json`**, etc.):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aegis": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@aegis-scan/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Tools exposed** (callable from the agent without leaving the chat):

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `aegis_scan` | Run a scan on a project path; returns findings + score |
| `aegis_findings` | Filter/query the most recent scan's findings |
| `aegis_score` | 0-1000 score + grade + badge for the scanned project |
| `aegis_compliance` | GDPR / SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / PCI-DSS posture summary |
| `aegis_fix_suggestion` | Get a fix suggestion for a specific finding |

Low-friction for developers who already run Claude Code / Cursor — your assistant can now scan and triage without a context-switch.

## VS Code Extension (preview)

An extension lives in `packages/vscode-extension/` and ships with this repo (currently at `0.2.0`, not yet on the VS Code Marketplace). It exposes:

- `AEGIS: Scan Workspace` command
- `AEGIS: Scan Current File` command
- `AEGIS: Show Security Score` command
- Configurable `aegis.autoScanOnSave` + `aegis.severity.minimum` settings

Build from source:

```bash
cd packages/vscode-extension
pnpm install && pnpm run build
pnpm run package   # produces .vsix
code --install-extension aegis-vscode-0.2.0.vsix
```

Marketplace publishing is planned for a future release; feedback on the current surface is welcome via Issues.

---

## CI/CD — GitHub Action

Drop-in security gate for any GitHub Actions workflow. Posts a PR comment with score, severity table, and top findings; fails the build when the score drops below a configurable threshold.

```yaml
name: Security
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  aegis:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: RideMatch1/a.e.g.i.s/ci/github-action@v0.7.2   # or @main for latest
        with:
          mode: scan           # 'scan' (quick) or 'audit' (full)
          path: .              # project to scan (default: '.')
          fail-below: 700      # set to 0 to never fail the build
          comment-on-pr: true  # post PR comment with findings table
```

**Inputs:** `mode`, `path`, `fail-below`, `comment-on-pr`. See `ci/github-action/action.yml` for the full schema. For reproducibility across team members, pin to a specific tag (`@v0.7.2`) rather than `@main`.
