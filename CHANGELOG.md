# Changelog

All notable changes to AEGIS are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). AEGIS uses
SemVer from v1.0; pre-1.0 (0.x) releases may include breaking changes,
which are called out in the relevant entry below.

Score-honesty convention: each milestone lists the **measured** honest
score, not the originally-targeted score. When they differ, both are
shown with the reason the target wasn't met.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-16 — "Cross-File Taint Foundation"

**Honest score:** 7.7 (unchanged from 0.6.1 — see "Known Limitations"
below for why the cross-file capability ship did not move the measured
score yet).

**Summary:** Whole-program cross-file taint propagation on top of the
v0.6 module-graph foundation. Taint tracks across imported function
calls via a function-summary cache; cross-file findings emit as SARIF
2.1.0 `locations` + `relatedLocations` pointing from the caller to the
cross-module origin.

### Added

- **Cross-file taint propagation** — taint now tracks across imported
  function calls using a function-summary cache and the v0.6 module
  graph. Supported patterns:
  - Bare-identifier callees (`import { fn }; fn(tainted);`)
  - Arrow-function-variable exports (`export const fn = (x) => ...`)
  - Default exports (`export default function (x) {...}`)
  - Declaration-style exports: `export { foo };` and `export { foo as bar };`
  - Barrel re-exports up to depth 5
  - Cross-file sanitizer recognition via `summary.sanitizesCwes`
- **SARIF 2.1.0 `relatedLocations`** — cross-file findings emit the
  primary location at the caller plus a related location at the
  cross-file origin. GitHub Code Scanning, GitLab, and Azure DevOps
  consumers can jump between the two. Non-cross-file findings do not
  emit spurious `relatedLocations`.
- **`Finding` type extensions**:
  - `crossFile?: boolean`
  - `crossFileOrigin?: string`
  - `confidence?: Confidence` — per-finding confidence tier (distinct
    from the scan-level `AuditResult.confidence`).
- **Benchmark 21/21 → 25/25 strict**. New fixtures in
  `packages/benchmark/vulnerable-app/`:
  - VULN-16 cross-file SQLi (tainted body → imported wrapper → `db.query()`)
  - VULN-17 cross-file XSS (tainted searchParam → imported renderer → `new Response(HTML)`)
  - CLEAN-07 cross-file sanitized (`parseInt()` wrap before sink — no finding)
  - CLEAN-08 re-exported identity (barrel-exported no-sink function — no finding)
- **Community-health files**: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant v2.1) added to lay the
  contribution path.

### Changed

- Tests 1283 → 1339 (+56) covering function-summary machinery, cross-file
  taint, SARIF round-trip, and module-graph integration.
- `function-summary.ts` and `taint-tracker.ts` now consult the shared
  `TAINT_SINKS` / `TAINT_SANITIZER_DEFS` / `PARSE_NOT_SANITIZER`
  registries as the single source of truth — earlier drafts had a
  drifted hand-maintained list.
- Cross-file findings ship at `confidence: 'medium'` as a calibration
  hedge; single-file findings retain the scanner default (see "Known
  Limitations" for the sample-size rationale).
- Package versions bumped 0.5.0 → 0.7.0 for all published workspace
  packages (`@aegis-scan/{core,scanners,reporters,cli,mcp-server}`) to
  align npm with the git tag.

### Fixed

- `JSON.parse`, `URL.parse`, `qs.parse`, `cookie.parse`, `path.parse`,
  `JSON5.parse` are no longer credited as sanitizers. They deserialize
  data; they do not validate it. Pre-fix, the cross-file check could
  silently suppress real findings that passed through these.
- CI flake on the `does NOT credit deserializers in PARSE_NOT_SANITIZER`
  test: a single shared `ts.Program` now amortises TypeChecker build
  cost across the 5 assertions (was per-assertion and timing out on
  Linux CI despite passing on macOS local).
- `findExportedFunction` previously skipped `export { foo };` and
  `export { foo as bar };` declaration-style exports, producing silent
  false negatives on any cross-file flow that used that pattern.
- `checkCrossFileCallSink` previously bailed on any callee whose bare
  name matched a `TAINT_SINKS` key (e.g. imported `fetch` or `exec`
  wrappers). Custom wrappers are now analysed correctly; reporter-side
  dedup handles the overlap between same-file and cross-file emissions.
- Per-CWE emission loop dropped subsequent CWEs after the first match;
  when a single param reached multiple sink classes, only one finding
  fired. All applicable CWEs now emit.

### Known Limitations

**Cross-file FP-rate is unmeasurable at current sample size.** The
initial 4-corpus dogfood produced n=2 cross-file findings (1 TP, 1 FP,
50% face-value precision). This is **below** the n≥20 threshold needed
for a statistically valid zone classification — each classification
shifts the rate by 50 percentage points at this sample size, so
"Red-zone" on face value is not a validated measurement. Cross-file
findings ship at `confidence: 'medium'` as a conservative hedge
pending a larger-corpus measurement. Single-file findings retain
their established scanner-default confidence.

**Four cross-file patterns deferred** — all require TypeChecker-based
symbol resolution that a future minor release will introduce. Syntax-
level handling in v0.7 would be fragile:

1. HOC / curry patterns wrapping a sink (`withAuth(sinkFn)`).
2. Generic pass-through return-taint (`const r = identityFn(x); sink(r);`).
3. Method-call cross-file callees (`obj.method(x)` where `obj` is imported).
4. Conditional-import confidence downgrade beyond the cross-file-global
   `medium` downgrade that ships here.

**Single-file refinement targets** (also deferred):

- URL-regex-whitelist recognition as a CWE-918 sanitizer.
- `Date.parse` added to the `PARSE_NOT_SANITIZER` blocklist.
- Type-aware sink resolution beyond `child_process` (`fs`, `path`,
  `crypto`, network modules).

### Migration Note

No breaking changes. `Finding.confidence`, `Finding.crossFile`, and
`Finding.crossFileOrigin` are all optional; consumers that ignore
these fields see the same `Finding` shape as before. SARIF consumers
that parse `relatedLocations` get richer output; those that ignore
it are unaffected.

## Prior releases (0.3 — 0.6.1)

Pre-v0.7 history exists on the git tag refs (`v0.6.0`, `v0.6.1`,
`v0.5.0`, etc.) but is consolidated here at the v0.7 cut to keep the
CHANGELOG narrative linear. Tag messages carry the per-release details
for anyone who needs the pre-0.7 commit-level trail.

Major capability milestones in the 0.3 → 0.6.1 arc:

- **0.3**: Initial public scanner suite.
- **0.5**: Precision CLI, Custom Rules DSL, type-aware `child_process`
  sink resolution, SARIF 2.1.0 conformance. Honest score 7.7.
- **0.6.0**: Foundation + 4 quick-win scanners + precision-tier gates.
  Multi-project OSS dogfood corpus introduced.
- **0.6.1**: Dogfood follow-through patch — three QUARANTINE scanners
  resolved via file-level-fingerprint stability, playwright-test-file
  exclusion, and parameterized-query FP elimination in the
  `sql-concat-checker`.
